# google-escpos
Python project to connect with a ESC/POS Thermal Printer and generate reports through the use of the Google API. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You will need to get your own API keys for accessing Google's services with this repository. For a walkthrough of how to do this, follow these instructions. (Coming Soon)

> [!NOTE]  
> This repository has been built and tested using a Canon RP10 Receipt Printer. It's possible (and very likely) there will be issues when using other thermal printers. Forks/Pull Requests are welcome to help expand compatibility with other ESC/POS devices.
